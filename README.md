# MLOps and Modern AI Engineering Portfolio

This repository documents my comprehensive learning path through 10 end-to-end Machine Learning, DevOps (MLOps), and Modern AI projects. The goal is to build a robust portfolio demonstrating practical skills across diverse methodologies and deployment scenarios.

## 🗺️ Project Roadmap and Status

The projects are organized into three core categories: **ML Foundations (A)**, **MLOps (B)**, and **Modern AI (C)**.
