# 💡 My 10-Project Machine Learning Journey

This repository documents my comprehensive learning path through 10 end-to-end Machine Learning, Data Engineering (MLOps), and Modern AI projects. The goal is to build a robust portfolio demonstrating practical skills across diverse methodologies and deployment scenarios.

## 🗺️ Project Roadmap and Status

The projects are organized into three core categories: **Foundations (A)**, **Engineering (B)**, and **Modern AI (C)**.

## 📂 Project Focus: A2 - Ames House Price Prediction

This folder contains the complete project notebook demonstrating **end-to-end Regression** using the Ames Housing dataset.

### Project Goals:

* Master complex data preprocessing (handling missing data based on domain context).
* Implement robust **Feature Engineering** techniques (e.g., `TotalSqFt`, `HouseAge`).
* Compare and select the best model (**Lasso Regression**) for high-dimensional data.
* Achieve a high-performance predictive model (Final RMSE: **$21,316.18**).
